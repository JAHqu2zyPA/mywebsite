In two back-to-back tragedies, [51 migrants were found dead](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/san-antonio-migrants-texas-tractor-trailer-dead-injured/){:target="_blank"} in a truck in Texas on Monday, the largest loss of migrant life in a single event in recent memory, just days after 23 migrants were found dead along the border of Melilla, a Spanish enclave in Northern Africa.

> On-the-ground reporting and further empirical investigations will tell us more in the days and weeks to come about the concrete circumstances surrounding this loss of life. But an observation that many of my colleagues have already been making is that these two losses of life are neither unique nor disconnected.

>> To the contrary, border securitization, which has ramped up globally in the years following fall of the Berlin Wall, is predicated upon a certain minimal and unavoidable amount of migrant death. Not only is this not an unforeseeable consequence, migrant death has very often been intentionally mobilized as a migration deterrent by both North American and European governments.

For instance, Luna Vives (@lunavives), a fellow geographer, recently wrote about Spain’s attempts to dismantle the NGO search and rescue operations networks, thereby “causing preventable deaths and disappearances at sea”. An accessible article can be read here at Border Criminologies (@BorderCrim), and is based on an academic article of the same name.

The same is true for the US-Mexico border region. A detailed report by James Verini (really outstanding reporting) examines the development of “prevention through deterrence” and the idea that the risk of death in the desert would reduce migration. As Verini reports:

"Doris Meissner, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the time, said later that “it was our sense that the number of people crossing through Arizona would go down to a trickle once people realized” how dangerous it was.

Spoiler alert: migrants were not deterred for many reasons, not the least of which is that violence and poverty in Central America, driving factors for migration, did not go away simply because the US government changed their border enforcement policy.

## Test Heading

As a consequence, border deaths have been significant. Last year, DHS recorded that 650 migrants died crossing the US-Mexico border, although the Missing Migrants Project, which tracks migrant deaths globally, reports that number to be nearly double that at 1,248. Ryan Devereaux addresses CBP’s alleged undercounting in an article “The Border Patrol Is Systemically Failing to Count Migrant Deaths.“ For more information about border deaths in the Arizona region, the Arizona OpenGIS Initiative for Deceased Migrants maps these deaths and makes the data available online.
